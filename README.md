Within each photo, Linnaea generates 100 equidistant points for species classification. The points can be navigated as well as the image can be panned/zoomed using the controls along the top.

### Point classification

Each point can be classified using the menus in the left hand panel. There are different sets of species classifications depending on what angle the site photo was taken from. When you upload a new photo, you will be prompted to choose an angle.

### Generate raw data report

Once you're finished classifying points, you can generate a raw data report as a .csv file using the _Export raw data_ option in the file menu. Before generating the report you have to choose a site name and then a save location. Then a .csv file will be generated with all your point classifications for each photo.
